Additional Oracle Install Steps:
--------------------------------
In order to use this gadget with an Oracle datastore, you will need to install the Oracle Instant Client & ODBC Drivers on your up.time monitoring.
The process for this varies for Windows & Linux. Once the appropriate ODBC Driver has been installed, you will need to edit the uptimeDB.php file for this gadget on your 
monitoring station ( <uptime_dir>/gadgets/definitions/uptime.MetricChart/uptimeDB.php this file may not exist until you've 'refreshed gadgets via the GUI') and uncomment one of the ODBC Driver lines near the top of the file . 

Oracle ODBC Driver Linux Install Steps:
--------------------
1. Install unixODBC via your package manager (ie. yum install unixodbc) . This will install unixODBC into your '/usr/lib64/' directory.

2. Download and Install the latest version of the 'Oracle Instant Client Basic' package, available from Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html). Keep in mind that up.time 7.2 comes bundled with 64bit Apache/PHP so you will need the Linux x86-64 package. ie. oracle-instantclient12.1-basic-12.1.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm . (The 12.1 package works with 11g Databases as well). This package will install some of the required binaries/drivers for Oracle into /usr/lib/oracle/<version>/client64/lib/

3. Download and install the ' ODBC: Additional libraries' package from Oracle (ie. oracle-instantclient12.1-odbc-12.1.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm  ). This provides the actual ODBC Driver we need from Oracle.

4. Edit the /etc/init.d/uptime_httpd script that starts up.time's apache, and add the following lines to set some of the required environment variables(This should be towards the beginning of the script add the end of to the other export commands ie. export PATH , export MIBDIRS etc). Make sure to change <version> to the correct version for the path where the drivers were installed in Step 2 above.

export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/<version>/client64
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib

 
5. Restart uptime_httpd service to pick up this change (ie. /etc/init.d/uptime_httpd stop  /etc/init.d/uptime_httpd start)

6. Make sure to uncomment one of the odbc driver lines in <uptime_dir>/gadgets/definitions/uptime.MetricChart/uptimeDB.php as explained above.


Oracle ODBC Driver Windows Install Steps:
-----------------------------------------

1. Install the Oracle Instant Client drivers or have the Oracle Client installed on the monitoring station. To get the Instant Client Download for Oracle, download the 64 bit drivers:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index.html

ie. instantclient-basic-windows.x64-12.1.0.1.0.zip

2. Create a new directory C:\Oracle. Unzip the downloaded file into the new directory. You should now have C:\Oracle\instantclient_12_1 which contains a bunch of .dll & .sym files.

3. Download the 'Instant Client Package - ODBC' from the same page above. ie. instantclient-odbc-windows.x64-12.1.0.1.0.zip . Extract this zip into the same C:\Oracle\instantclient_12_1 path.

4. Open a command prompt in the C:\Oracle\instantclient_12_1 directory and run the odbc_install.exe which will install the Oracle ODBC drivers and setup the required Environment variables.

5. Run the 'Data Sources (ODBC)' utility from the Windows 'Administrative Tools'. Click on the 'Drivers' tab, and confirm that you have an 'Oracle in instantclient' driver listed, and note the name of the driver, as this is required as the 'ODBC Driver Name' when setting up the service monitor. (Likely it will be 'Oracle in instantclient_12_1' or 'Oracle in OraClient12Home1').

6. Update the Path Environment Variable to include the path to the oracle driver. Append ";C:\Oracle\instantclient_12_1" to end of the variable.
To set this variable Go to System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables > Under System variables find Path and edit it.

7. Make sure to uncomment one of the odbc driver lines in  <uptime_dir>/gadgets/definitions/uptime.MetricChart/uptimeDB.php as explained above.

If your having trouble with installing just the Oracle InstantClient & ODBC the likely issue is you are missing "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)" package that has the DLL that this driver needs, another option is to install these drivers as part of the 'Oracle Data Access Components' which is a bundle of Oracle drivers full fleged installer compared to the zips mentioned above. This bundle can be found on the Oracle website here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/windows/downloads/index.html


Additional MSSQL/SQLServer Install Steps:
-----------------------------------------

In order to use the Metric Chart gadget with a SQLServer based Datastore, you will need to uncomment the appropriate ODBC Driver in <uptime_dir>/gadgets/definitions/uptime.MetricChart/uptimeDB.php

Windows Based monitoring stations will already have ODBC itself installed as part of Windows. 

But Linux based monitoring stations will require the unixODBC package to be installed.

This package should include the /usr/lib64/libtdsodbc.so.0 SQLServer ODBC Driver needed for MSSQL/SQLserver.

See step #1 of 'Oracle ODBC Driver Linux Install Steps:' above for more details on installing unixODBC




Upgrading from an earlier version of the Metric Chart
-----------------------------------------------------
* Install/upgrade to  the new version of the gadget via the Extension Manager (Goto the Dashboards Tab -> Click the Gear Icon in the upper right corner, and select 'Search for Gadgets' )

* Navigate to the Up.time Dashboards where your metric chart gadget is located.

* Add a new Gadget and click on 'Refresh Gadgets' button to find the new version of the Metric Chart

* Choose your metrics & graph!
